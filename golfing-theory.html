    <!-- Section 1: Golf Swing Theory -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Understanding the Golf Swing</h2>
      <img src="your-diagram-1.gif" alt="Golf Swing Diagram">
      <p>Mastering the golf swing involves understanding key concepts such as posture, grip, stance, and rotation. A consistent and powerful swing comes from proper technique, not brute strength. Here's where you learn how to generate speed and accuracy while maintaining control.</p>
      <ul class="pointer-list">
        <li>Keep your spine straight to ensure proper posture during the swing.</li>
        <li>A good grip is essential for control over the club and shot accuracy.</li>
        <li>Rotate your body, not just your arms, for a full, powerful swing.</li>
        <li>Focus on a smooth tempo rather than over-exerting yourself.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Mental Aspects of Golf -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Mental Game of Golf</h2>
      <img src="your-diagram-2.gif" alt="Mental Focus in Golf">
      <p>Golf is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. Understanding how to stay calm under pressure, visualize shots, and overcome challenges is vital to lowering your score. Focus on the process, not the outcome, to perform at your best on the course.</p>
      <ul class="pointer-list">
        <li>Stay present and focus on each shot instead of dwelling on past mistakes.</li>
        <li>Visualize your shots before hitting them to improve your shot-making accuracy.</li>
        <li>Learn to accept mistakes and maintain a positive mindset throughout the round.</li>
        <li>Develop a pre-shot routine to help calm nerves and focus the mind.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Course Management -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Effective Course Management</h2>
      <img src="your-diagram-3.gif" alt="Course Management Strategy">
      <p>Good course management means knowing when to play aggressively and when to play it safe. Understanding the layout of the course, choosing the right club, and controlling your shot selection can help you score lower by avoiding risky situations.</p>
      <ul class="pointer-list">
        <li>Understand your strengths and play to them, selecting shots that maximize your chances of success.</li>
        <li>Learn to evaluate risk versus reward, especially on tight or water-laden holes.</li>
        <li>Use the right club for each situation to keep the ball in play and avoid unnecessary hazards.</li>
        <li>Plan your shots based on course conditions, such as wind and elevation changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4: Short Game Techniques -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Mastering the Short Game</h2>
      <img src="your-diagram-4.gif" alt="Short Game Tips">
      <p>The short game (putting, chipping, pitching) is critical to lowering your scores. Most shots are taken within 100 yards of the green, so developing a solid short game is essential. Learn proper technique for each shot to improve accuracy and confidence around the greens.</p>
      <ul class="pointer-list">
        <li>For chips and pitches, use a variety of clubs to master different lies and distances.</li>
        <li>Focus on having a consistent chipping motion with a solid follow-through.</li>
        <li>In putting, ensure that your eyes are directly over the ball to aid alignment.</li>
        <li>Practice distance control to improve your ability to sink putts from different ranges.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5: Putting Mechanics -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Perfecting Your Putting Stroke</h2>
      <img src="your-diagram-5.gif" alt="Putting Technique">
      <p>Putting requires a smooth and consistent stroke. Learn how to align your putter correctly, how to read the green, and how to control your speed. Developing these skills will allow you to become a more effective putter and reduce the number of putts per round.</p>
      <ul class="pointer-list">
        <li>Ensure your putter face is square to the target line at setup.</li>
        <li>Read the slope of the green before making your putt, adjusting for break and speed.</li>
        <li>Practice a smooth, pendulum-like putting motion to maintain control and consistency.</li>
        <li>Work on your putting stroke to improve both accuracy and distance control.</li>
      </ul>
